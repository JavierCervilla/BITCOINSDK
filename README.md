BITCOIN SDK

This is an Opensource Work in progress project, the aim is to have an straightforward way to access bitcoin in any react dapp allowing the interaction with many diferent wallets, making easy to access any protocol on the main chain as Counterparty or SRC20.


To install use your favorite package manager:

`npm install bitcoinsdk`

If you are using deno use:

`deno add npm:bitcoinsdk`

This package is split in two:

you can use `bitcoinsdk/core` if you dont need to use the ui components and just want to get access to the available methods to interact with bitcoin, counterparty and openbook.

you can use `bitcoinsdk/ui`if you want to use the prebuild ui components available, this components made use of the core functions to make you really easy to integrate in any react app.


More detailed docs will be available soon, this is an Opensource project so if you want to help, you are welcome ❤️
